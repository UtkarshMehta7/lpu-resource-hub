# CLAUDE.md: LPU Research Intelligence & Collaboration Hub

## What this is
Prototype research discovery & collaboration platform for the LPU ecosystem.
NOT an official LPU system unless formally adopted or authorized.
All data is fictional demo data. Never present fabricated data as real LPU data.

## Source of truth
- docs/architecture.md (approved architecture): follow it, don't redesign it.
- docs/adr/: record every significant decision as a new ADR (000N-title.md).
- README roadmap table: one step at a time. NEVER build ahead of the current step.
- lpu-roadmap-prompts.md: the full step-by-step roadmap and per-step prompts.

## Stack (do not replace)
Backend: Python 3.12+, FastAPI, Pydantic v2 / pydantic-settings, SQLAlchemy 2.0 (sync) + psycopg 3, Alembic
DB: PostgreSQL 16+ only (never SQLite). Uses FTS, pg_trgm, btree_gist, pgvector later.
Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript strict, Vite, Tailwind 4, React Router, Axios, TanStack Query, RHF + Zod
AI: scikit-learn (TF-IDF) now; sentence-transformers + pgvector later. Local only, no paid APIs.
Tooling: ruff, mypy --strict, pytest | eslint, prettier, tsc

## Hard rules
- Zero cost. No paid APIs, no mandatory cloud, Docker optional only.
- RBAC is enforced on the BACKEND. Frontend guards only hide UI.
- Role/active status always loaded from the DB, never trusted from token/client.
- 401 = not authenticated; 403 = authenticated but not allowed; 404 = must not know it exists.
- Never commit secrets or .env. All config via env vars; .env.example has placeholders only.
- Every schema change = reviewed Alembic migration with sequential rev id (--rev-id 000N).
  Never use Base.metadata.create_all().
- Separate Create/Update/Response Pydantic schemas. role, owner_id, status are never client-writable.
- Routers: HTTP only. Services: business rules, no FastAPI imports. Policies: ownership/scope.
- Workflow status transitions defined in ONE table per workflow and enforced in services.
- Business APIs under /api/v1. Errors use envelope {"error":{"code","message","details"}}.
- Sensitive actions (role change, approvals, deletions, admin actions) write to audit log (from Step 2).
- No new dependency without a stated purpose. No `any`, no broad `# type: ignore`,
  no disabling lint rules to pass checks.
- Tests use a real PostgreSQL test DB (TEST_DATABASE_URL), each test rolled back.
- Don't claim something works unless you ran it. Unverified = say "NOT VERIFIED".

## Commands
Backend (backend/, venv active): ruff check . && ruff format --check . && mypy && pytest
Run: uvicorn app.main:create_app --factory --reload
Migrate: alembic upgrade head
Frontend (frontend/): npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm run format:check && npm run test && npm run build
Run: npm run dev

## Workflow for every step
1. Read CLAUDE.md, docs/architecture.md, and the step prompt.
2. Give a concise PLAN (files, models, endpoints, migrations, tests, deviations). STOP for approval.
3. Implement only that step on branch feat/step-N-<name>.
4. Run all checks + the step's verification list. Fix root causes.
5. Update README status/roadmap, docs/architecture.md if needed, add ADR if a decision was made.
6. Report: summary, files, deps, migrations, endpoints, checks (PASSED/FAILED/NOT VERIFIED),
   deviations, commands to run, next step. Then STOP.
